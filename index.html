            <p>
              My name is Eneje Chukwuebuka Lawrence but i prefer going by the
              name "Dibia". I am from Enugu, Nigeria. I am currently enrolled in
              the Cloud Engineering program at Alt School Africa, where I am in
              my first semester with the Karatu cohort, focusing on Front-End
              Engineering. I belong to Circle 10 and 17. The program has been
              challenging due to its flexible teaching model, but it has also
              made it possible for anyone who is willing and curious about
              technology to engage and learn from anywhere in the world. This is
              my CSS assignment.
